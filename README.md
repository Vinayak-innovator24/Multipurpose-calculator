# Multipurpose-calculator

This project is majorly focused on using more javascript in the backend through the use of expressjs, a nodejs framework. Functions like 'GET', 'POST', 'send', 'sendFile' have been used to receive data from server and also to send data to server.
Difference between "send" and 'sendFile' is that 'send' gives the data in form of text to the server whereas 'sendFile' gives data in the form of files.
